      My dearest Dream,  
      <br><br>
      From the moment we met in Darjeeling, everything felt like a scene from a movie.  
      The mist, the laughter, your smile – all became part of my heart’s favorite story.  
      I created this to remind you that you are deeply cherished.  
      You are, and always will be, my most beautiful Dream.
      <br><br>
      Yours,  
      [Your Name]
